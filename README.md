#Fatigue
_Fight like a wolf_

*Mission*
Fight with cunning where every move you make has consiquence and effect.

*Changes*
* Signs Cost less to cast 
* Stamina regeneration is the same in and outside of combat
* Stamina regeneration is much slower
* Attacking costs stamina
* Dodging costs stamina
* Rolling costs stamina 
* guarding dosent slow down stamina any fruther case that dosent make sense
* Sprinting drains less stamina and begins to drain stamina straight away

*Advice*
Play more meticiously, calculate when which move is worth making, give yourself time to get your stamina back during a fight.
Play on death march. I havent tested it on other difficulties.

*Notes*
I plan this to be mod one of a chain of mods designed to bring realistic combat and experience to the witcher.

*Feedback*
Give it to me!

*Improve the mod?*
Mods available on github, with a neat packing script and all that you can just download and play with it, if you want to learn from it improve it or integrate it in yer own.

*Packing*
Change packing variables to the paths the variables tell you they are meant to be and you are good to go.
Do not (for the love of the lord) make you modPath a path with spaces otherwise it will flop.
